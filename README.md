## Vibe2Ship · A Product Lab for the AI Era

A community of builders shipping real products with AI — sharing what actually works.

### What We Talk About

- AI tools that are genuinely useful (no ads, just stuff we actually use)
- Hard-won lessons from going zero to launch
- How to put the latest AI capabilities to work in your own projects
- First-hand insights and info edges for indie builders

### Workshop

Free online workshops every two weeks — from idea to launch, built together.

### Open Source

We open-source the good stuff → [Awesome-Skills](https://github.com/vibe2ship/Awesome-Skills)

Come hang out — ask questions, share what you're building, or just lurk.

### Philosophy

No fluff, just practice. No courses to sell, just work to ship.

Everyone here is building something. Lurkers welcome.
